Reproduction.

Cannabis normally has imperfect flowers, with staminate "male" and pistillate "female" flowers occurring on separate plants. [10] It is not unusual, however, for individual plants to bear both male and female flowers. [11] Although monoecious plants are often referred to as "hermaphrodites", true hermaphrodites (which are less common) bear staminate and pistillate structures together on individual flowers, whereas monoecious plants bear male and female flowers at different locations on the same plant. Male flowers are normally borne on loose panicles, and female flowers are borne on racemes. [12] "At a very early period the Chinese recognized the Cannabis plant as dioecious",[13] and the (c. 3rd century BCE) Erya dictionary defined xi ? "male Cannabis" and fu ? (or ju ?) "female Cannabis". [14]

All known strains of Cannabis are wind-pollinated[15] and the fruit is an achene. [16] Most strains of Cannabis are short day plants,[15] with the possible exception of C. sativa subsp. sativa var. spontanea (= C. ruderalis), which is commonly described as "auto-flowering" and may be day-neutral.
